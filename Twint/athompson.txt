1243704267854295040 2020-03-27 20:59:39 -0400 <athompson> The tragedy unfolding in NYC hospitals is heartbreaking. But we can reverse the trend.  Sign this NYC doctor's petition begging Gov. Cuomo to adapt stricter protocols at COVID-only hospitals that will #ProtectOurHeroes &amp; give ER patients a fighting chance   https://t.co/3Pyh4SXWpF

1239713578896277504 2020-03-16 20:42:04 -0400 <athompson> I am tweeting this because my friend has spent the last 3 weeks doing everything he can to fight for more serious protections that will keep health care workers &amp; patients safe - but we're still falling way short, so I'm trying to help get the word out. /end
1239711061487558658 2020-03-16 20:32:04 -0400 <athompson> We need to use empty buildings/colleges/cruise ships and create hermetic quarantines for COVID-19 patients - and house for much longer than 2 weeks.  https://t.co/m62hV7GCiX  https://t.co/XkF9aD31Ct
1239709124792811520 2020-03-16 20:24:22 -0400 <athompson> We need negative pressure tent pods that pull airborne disease particles out of the air as a separate triage for ONLY COVID-19/respiratory illnesses cases to protect the main ER staff and patients from possible infection.  https://t.co/ILqL4UUQaJ
1239708812837257216 2020-03-16 20:23:08 -0400 <athompson> To know what we DO need to protect ppl, all we have to do is look at the photos: These doctors in China are wearing full body protective suits with face shield/n95 respirators or PAPR (Ebola level). This is what our health care workers need.  https://t.co/3s3lJ4jtcz
1239707086340177921 2020-03-16 20:16:16 -0400 <athompson> More protection is needed b/c studies are finding you don’t need to be directly coughed on to get the virus - it can linger in air for up to 3 hours. Medical settings (contained spaces) are the most susceptible to this kind of transmission.   https://t.co/mHPuk9Dbxj
1239704510068654082 2020-03-16 20:06:02 -0400 <athompson> In the US health workers are being asked to work with the everyday masks you see on Grey’s Anatomy. Compare the protection our health workers are being given to what’s been used in China:  https://t.co/6xdPQp3fZ7
1239702052638527488 2020-03-16 19:56:16 -0400 <athompson> Last week the CDC downgraded their guidelines to allow health care workers attending to COVID-19 patients to merely use general surgical masks when more protective N95 respirators aren’t available.    https://t.co/wc4x9fjRcd  https://t.co/q2vG6MKw7B
1239700992670793728 2020-03-16 19:52:03 -0400 <athompson> My friend is a hospital doctor working on the frontlines at a NYC hospital battling coronavirus. He’s terrified what we’re doing is falling tragically short of what’s needed to protect us from this highly contagious deadly virus. What he’s most worried about at his hospital: 1/
