1531678777020821504 2022-05-31 12:47:32 -0400 <FerikaBoss> @SNazerine @danhonks I was a dragon lady the last time I played. I just feel so far behind and don't want to play through all the content T_T
1531672662400897025 2022-05-31 12:23:14 -0400 <FerikaBoss> @EndlessPillows Are the ranks different taco ingredients or different types of tacos?
1531672483761254400 2022-05-31 12:22:31 -0400 <FerikaBoss> @RiotGearhook I hate anime and dislike the feeling of movement in that game. I also have fundamental issues with the fact that I either have to play through years of content OR pay money to get to current content
1531671410745016320 2022-05-31 12:18:16 -0400 <FerikaBoss> @danhonks @SNazerine Yeah idk I've never liked cats

1531671179055931393 2022-05-31 12:17:20 -0400 <FerikaBoss> @SNazerine So here's a fun fact about me: I deeply dislike cats. I'm also INCREDIBLY allergic. But I also just don't get the appeal. I'm a BIG scary dog kinda person
1531669362305691648 2022-05-31 12:10:07 -0400 <FerikaBoss> I lied. I also want tacos
1531669307758768128 2022-05-31 12:09:54 -0400 <FerikaBoss> All I want in life is to lose myself in MMO raiding once again. But none of the MMOs that have raiding interest me anymore
