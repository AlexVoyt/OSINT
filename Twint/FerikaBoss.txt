1531848669908987905 2022-06-01 00:02:37 -0400 <FerikaBoss> @EndlessPillows I'm pretty partial to Al Pastor
1531732344389873664 2022-05-31 16:20:23 -0400 <FerikaBoss> @Khelevaster @SNazerine @danhonks I refuse to pay
1531681734470709248 2022-05-31 12:59:17 -0400 <FerikaBoss> @karebearkorner I actually loved Destiny 2!
1531679056545992705 2022-05-31 12:48:38 -0400 <FerikaBoss> @jwalsh_music @Ludvig_Forssell Where's your Monster Energy?
1531678777020821504 2022-05-31 12:47:32 -0400 <FerikaBoss> @SNazerine @danhonks I was a dragon lady the last time I played. I just feel so far behind and don't want to play through all the content T_T
1531672662400897025 2022-05-31 12:23:14 -0400 <FerikaBoss> @EndlessPillows Are the ranks different taco ingredients or different types of tacos?
1531672483761254400 2022-05-31 12:22:31 -0400 <FerikaBoss> @RiotGearhook I hate anime and dislike the feeling of movement in that game. I also have fundamental issues with the fact that I either have to play through years of content OR pay money to get to current content
1531671410745016320 2022-05-31 12:18:16 -0400 <FerikaBoss> @danhonks @SNazerine Yeah idk I've never liked cats
1531671260421271552 2022-05-31 12:17:40 -0400 <FerikaBoss> @swampyhag It is so tempting but I feel like I can't idk
1531671179055931393 2022-05-31 12:17:20 -0400 <FerikaBoss> @SNazerine So here's a fun fact about me: I deeply dislike cats. I'm also INCREDIBLY allergic. But I also just don't get the appeal. I'm a BIG scary dog kinda person
1531669362305691648 2022-05-31 12:10:07 -0400 <FerikaBoss> I lied. I also want tacos
1531669307758768128 2022-05-31 12:09:54 -0400 <FerikaBoss> All I want in life is to lose myself in MMO raiding once again. But none of the MMOs that have raiding interest me anymore

1529863065771991051 2022-05-26 12:32:33 -0400 <FerikaBoss> Is there a dad bod equivalent for women that isn't mom bod? I want to look like I can lift really heavy weights and also fucking destroy some nachos and ice cream

1528880480937881601 2022-05-23 19:28:06 -0400 <FerikaBoss> I've become immune to the effects of salt and vinegar chips. Does anyone know any strong ones that will make my tongue bleed? I just want my food to cause me pain
1528769932246142976 2022-05-23 12:08:49 -0400 <FerikaBoss> @EmmanDaBomb My at home tests were negative for 5 days but positive after my PCR

1528456210990497792 2022-05-22 15:22:12 -0400 <FerikaBoss> @catacalypto @karebearkorner It's kinda silly in that I went on TikTok and the algorithm just eventually found my aesthetic and I started to search for a bunch of grwm's (get ready with me) for women with my aesthetic (goth) and then started getting the store names. It took trial and error on the shops tho
1528446183860948993 2022-05-22 14:42:22 -0400 <FerikaBoss> @karebearkorner I did a complete wardrobe overhaul during the pandemic and am here to talk 👀

1526961151103291392 2022-05-18 12:21:22 -0400 <FerikaBoss> @TBSkyen @LeagueOfLegends @riotgames Hey TB this was absolutely my bad for not including the credit in the initial post. We did push it live to credit the original artist, and it was suggested by Sunny originally.  100% my bad and absolutely an oversight on my part. The change should have gone live yesterday!
1526958407713890305 2022-05-18 12:10:28 -0400 <FerikaBoss> Coming into the office is nice and all but I'm sick of making small talk with everyone
1526943025988915200 2022-05-18 11:09:21 -0400 <FerikaBoss> @TheTruexy @RiotPhlox @tapu_goated I'll come to your desk and read you my first draft out loud later
1526939283663114240 2022-05-18 10:54:29 -0400 <FerikaBoss> @vtchalakov 🥴 similar energy
1526939142348673026 2022-05-18 10:53:55 -0400 <FerikaBoss> @vtchalakov @wuffles This is where sharing comp with your colleagues is important!!! With new hires and old timers alike. But yes, longtime people are often shafted because new hires get higher offers and then the people there for a long time are left in the dust
1526935741074264065 2022-05-18 10:40:24 -0400 <FerikaBoss> @wuffles "We need senior talent!" Doesn't promote employees already performing at that level

1526784104229834752 2022-05-18 00:37:51 -0400 <FerikaBoss> @tapu_goated @RiotPhlox "Sh-Shaco..." Fiora starts.  He appears suddenly before her and rests a finger on her lips. "This will be fun," he croons. Fiora's toes curl at the promise in her voice. His finger trails down her lips, to her chin, down her neck. She swallows.
